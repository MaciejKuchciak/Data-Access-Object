# Data Access Object
A project where via classes an user can Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) data from database.

---

## About application

The application based on an object-oriented data access layer is able to perform database operations depending on the command that has been chosen by the user. The data for our program is stored in a database called `DAO` in a table `users`. An SQL insetion query for your convinience has been added up to the project in SQL file under the name `insertion.sql`.

The application has the following features:
> - displaying all users from the table `users`
> - exit from the application
> - adding a new user
> - deleting an user
> - updating an user
> - loading data from a database at application startup
> - validating the user's choice
> - hashing user's password inserted into database

In this project I combined my knowledge in the field of OOP and MySQL by calling individual methods of the UserDao class and verify that they have the desired effect in the database. I have used such new-learned things as:
> - classes (DbUtils, User with getters and setters, UserDao)
> - objects
> - reading data using SQL
> - deleting data using SQL
> - changing data with SQL
> - hashing password using BCrypt.hashpw method.
